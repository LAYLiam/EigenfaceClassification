# EigenfaceClassification
In March 1991, researchers Turk &amp; Pentland from MIT released a paper titled "Face Recognition Using Eigenfaces" &lt;see here https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/Papers/mturk-CVPR91.pdf>. This project seeks to implement the methods proposed by these researchers using modern languages (Python) with the hope of achieving real-time face classification.
